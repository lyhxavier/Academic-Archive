### Who am I?
I am a psychology major, currently pursuing my **Bachelor of Social Sciences (Honours) in Psychology (2022-2026)** with **Nanyang Technological University, Singapore**. I currently hold a **Diploma (with Merit) in Psychology Studies**, and will be completing my studies in the **Specialist Diploma in Gerontology (Optimal Ageing Practice)** in mid-2022.

In the future, I have plans to specialise in **Clinical Neuropsychology**. This interest was ignited and grew from my prolonged involvement in clinical psychological and arts & dementia research, and neuropsychological observations under the supervision of a practicing clinical neuropsychologist.

I am a passionate volunteer too! In my free time, I dedicate my service to a wide range of voluntary roles, play the piano, occasionally play video games, and read fictional/ psychology novels. I love to write too, which explains the formation of this archive!

### What is Psychology?
**Psychology** is the scientific study of the human mind. Psychologists work in many different settings, such as in the workplace (*Occupational Psychologists*), in the community (*Health/ Community Psychologists*), in criminal justice (*Forensic Psychologists*), and in clinical practice (*Clinical Psychologists*).

**Clinical Neuropsychology** is a sub-speciality of Clinical Psychology, and concerns understanding the relationship between brain and behaviour. Their expertise are often leveraged to diagnose disorders of the brain, and assess cognitive-behavioural functioning to facilitate effective treatment.
