## **Introduction**

Miles is my loyal canine companion and has been ever since I was young. As an adolescent, whenever I encountered conflicts in my life, I would spend some time with Miles to disengage myself from the reality of life. Sometimes, I would even vent my emotional turmoil to Miles, all the while believing that he understood my emotions. Miles is hence not only my loyal companion but also a source of psychological comfort to me, to the extent I would occasionally ask myself if Miles – along with his other non-human animal counterparts – is capable of comprehending and expressing human-specific emotions.

Are humans alone in their ability to experience and reason on the basis of unobservable mental states (e.g., intentions, emotions, beliefs)? The question – *whether non-human animals can understand mental states* – is the basis for long-standing investigations in the psychological community ever since 1978 when Premack and Woodruff posed the question: *“Does the chimpanzee have a ‘theory of mind’?”*. In this article, I will be supplementing a primer on the theory of mind before confronting three contentious questions on animal sentience: 
1. What do we already know about the theory of mind in non-human animals?
2. Why can’t a scientific consensus be reached yet?
3. What do we need to examine further to delineate the theory of mind in non-human animals?

## **Theory of Mind: Definition and Constituents**

Theory of mind (ToM), or mental state attribution, as conceptualised by Premack and Woodruff (1978) refers to the capacity to ascribe mental states (e.g., desires, intentions) to others. The ability to ascribe mental states allows us to infer, predict, or manipulate others’ behaviours. For instance, while writing this article, I am trying to interpret the goals of you, the reader, which allows me to outline the narrative to suit your needs. I am also trying to understand the background knowledge you have about this topic, and how I can frame this article to stimulate your intellectual curiosity while ensuring that the concepts covered will be well-comprehended by you. ToM is hence central to what makes us “truly human”, allowing us to communicate and cooperate as social beings. Today, ToM is typically studied by developmental psychologists to understand its developmental trends in children and its implications in social interactions (Devine & Lecce, 2021). To better understand the neurological origins of ToM, comparative psychologists over the past 40 years have been trying to extrapolate the existence of this ability to non-human animals, attempting to determine whether ToM is truly unique to us.

**Theory of Mind**
: The capacity to ascribe mental states (e.g., desires, intentions) to others.

Neuropsychologists (Brothers & Ring, 1992) have proposed a framework for understanding the constituents of ToM, and two prominent representations were outlined: cognitive and affective. Cognitive ToM concerns mental states, beliefs, and intentions of people, and often involves metacognition – the process of thinking about one’s own thoughts and understanding the basis of those thoughts (Kuhn, 2000). Another constituent of cognitive ToM is false beliefs – the understanding that other people can possess beliefs about the world that contradict reality (Carpendale & Chandler, 1996). Affective ToM concerns the emotional states of others, and usually involves empathy – the capacity to vicariously experience the emotions of others without necessarily understanding the reasons underlying those emotions. Both the cognitive and affective representations of ToM allow us to understand the behaviour of others, guiding our social interactions and perceptions (Brothers & Ring, 1992).

So, why should we study ToM in non-human animals? The cognitive architecture and mechanisms that underlie ToM in humans are complex – we still do not fully comprehend how it emerges, though we understand its importance in social cognition (Powell & Carey, 2017). By studying ToM in non-human animals, we can inferentially reconstruct the evolutionary precursors of ToM, allowing us to better understand its cognitive underpinnings (Krupenye et al., 2017).



### **Historical Underpinnings of Theory of Mind in Non-human Animals**

Before we can shed insights into whether Miles and his non-human counterparts have a ToM, we need to determine whether animals with a cognitive architecture similar to the sophisticated brains of humans are capable of this feat, for which primates serve as suitable candidates. Premack and Woodruff (1978) were the first researchers to publish a paper discussing their speculations about ToM in primates. In their research, they experimentally investigated whether a chimpanzee (Sarah) was capable of “imputing mental states to others” by constructing videotapes of a human actor reaching an inaccessible object. In the experiment, the videotapes were shown to Sarah and, subsequently, two photographs were presented to her – one that depicts the solution for the human actor to retrieve the object, and the other not. Sarah was tasked to select one of the two photographs, and whenever she selected the solution to the problem in the videotape, a researcher reinforced her behaviour by telling her, “Good Sarah, that’s right”, or “No, Sarah, that’s wrong”. Premack and Woodruff hence sought to understand whether Sarah could understand the intentions of the actor (i.e., wanting to retrieve the object) and select an action that was aligned to those intentions. Interestingly, they found that Sarah selected the solution in 21 out of 24 trials, providing a strong indication that she could indeed understand and act accordingly.



### **What do we currently know?**
Following Premack and Woodruff’s novel research, related research has also suggested that apes possessed some semblance of ToM, particularly the awareness of what others could see, hear, and what others knew on the basis of seeing. For instance, apes relied on verbal gestural communication cues when a human was oriented towards them rather than away when attempting to communicate with them (Kaminski et al., 2004). Moreover, in tasks associated with competition for resources, they actively concealed their strategy and preferentially approached food to which a competitor was oblivious or unaware (Karg et al., 2015a, 2015b).

Even though these findings suggested that apes hold a non-egocentric view of reality, other studies failed to demonstrate the ability of apes to go beyond understanding to representing others’ beliefs. In a standard experimental paradigm adapted from developmental psychology research on ToM in preverbal infants (Baron-Cohen et al., 1985), an actor would watch the process of an object hidden in one location, and the same actor would be absent while the object was moved. Even though apes were exposed to the whole process and witnessed the bait, they failed to leverage on the fact that the actor held a false belief – the belief that the object was still in the location that they had last seen it (Krachun et al., 2009, 2010). Altogether, these findings suggest that apes can track the intentions of others, and visual and auditory perceptions that motivate others’ behaviours, but they cannot represent beliefs held by others (Hare, 2011). 

### **Why can’t a scientific consensus be reached yet?**

Despite Sarah’s positive demonstration as well as various other reported successful confirmations of ToM amongst various non-human animal species over subsequent decades, contemporary scientists hold the belief that there is still no research conducted that could provide unequivocal support for behaviours undertaken by non-human animals that could be underlain by ToM (Krupenye & Call, 2019). The question holds – after years of extensive research into this topic, why can’t a scientific consensus be reached? van der Vaart and Hemelrijk (2014) suggested that experiments are fundamentally flawed to begin with.

Across many different experiments (Hurley & Nudds, 2006; Lurz, 2009), a common limitation is that the experimental designs are fundamentally incapable of distinguishing behaviours underlain by ToM, and behaviours associated with understanding the physical environment. ToM is the ability to comprehend and interpret unobservable inner mental states, beyond mere physical representations. In Sarah’s case, she could think about the actor’s intentions and purposes in line with ToM, or she could also think about the logical flow of events based on similar events to which she was previously exposed (Premack & Woodruff, 1978); both explanations are equally sufficient to solve the problem. Hence, in these experiments, subjects can reason based on what they can see and would do in a similar situation, without necessarily comprehending the mental states of the actor. 

### **What do we need to examine further?**
Today, comparative psychologists advocate for the pursuit of novel techniques to advance our current understanding of behaviours in non-human animals that could be underlain by ToM (Krupenye & Call, 2019). This includes innovative methodologies that encompass stronger controls and leverage advancements in visual intelligence technologies, such as the gaze-based paradigm which involves examining anticipatory looking and violation-of-expectations. Such methods have shifted the research paradigm in not only developmental psychology but are also increasingly shifting the empirical landscape of comparative psychology, holding latent potential to further our understanding of animal cognition (Baillargeon et al., 2016). Future studies could also consider directly delineating specific mechanisms of ToM by taxing those mechanisms and exploring if limited cognitive resources will reduce performance on ToM tasks (Powell & Carey, 2017).

Shifting our empirical lenses to phylogeny – the study of the evolution of species, it is also crucial to broaden the coverage of species studied in ToM tasks in hopes to determine the uniqueness of this cognitive ability in specific species. This would mandate well-controlled experiments designed to establish whether specific ToM abilities (e.g., inhibitory control) are underpinned by a common neurological mechanism. Broad phylogenetic analyses would also allow comparative psychologists to understand how social cognition evolved across similar species (e.g., dogs and wolves; MacLean et al., 2014). These efforts would allow us to determine the phylogenetic origins of ToM, and if social cognition can only develop when selective pressures are present in the social environment.

#### **Conclusion**
Finally, we turn back to the questions posed at the start of the article: Do non-human animals have a theory of mind? Is Miles capable of comprehending emotions and ascribing mental states to others? Well, we simply do not know, yet. Nonetheless, this has not demotivated animal researchers and comparative psychologists to pursue a definitive answer; it definitely has not demotivated me from interacting with Miles as though he understands me perfectly. Contemporary scientists studying animal cognition are still innovating novel experimental techniques in an attempt to make progress towards a sound conclusion (Alcaro et al., 2017; Kano et al., 2019; Kuznar et al., 2020). As an animal lover myself, I believe that this line of research is not too much about the pursuit of a definitive conclusion, but the realisation that non-human animals are to a degree capable of understanding and expressing emotions previously thought to be human-centric.
