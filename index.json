I am a psychology student, currently pursuing my Bachelor of Social Sciences in Psychology (2022-2026) with Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I currently hold a Diploma (with Merit) in Psychology Studies and a Specialist Diploma in Gerontology (Optimal Ageing Practice) from Temasek Polytechnic, Singapore. Currently, I am serving my conscription with the Republic of Singapore Navy as a Project Assistant (Industrial \u0026 Organisational Psychology). My day-to-day job involves conducting both quantitative and qualitative research in the Navy’s human resource operations. I am also heavily engaged in data analytics, where I supervise the development, administration, analysis, and report of psychometric assessments designed to diagnose organisational climate. In the future, I have plans to specialise in Clinical Neuropsychology, a sub-speciality of Clinical Psychology which entails the assessments, diagnoses, and interventions of brain disorders. This interest was ignited and grew from my prolonged involvement in clinical psychological and arts and dementia research, and neuropsychological observations under the supervision of a practicing clinical neuropsychologist. I am a passionate volunteer too! In my free time, I dedicate my service to a wide range of voluntary roles, play the piano and video games, and read. I love to write too, which explains the formation of this archive!
