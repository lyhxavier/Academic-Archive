I currently hold a Diploma (with Merit) in Psychology Studies, and will be completing my studies in the Specialist Diploma in Gerontology (Optimal Ageing Practice) in mid-2022. In the future, I have plans to specialise in Clinical Neuropsychology. This interest was ignited and grew from my prolonged involvement in clinical psychological and arts \u0026 dementia research, and neuropsychological observations under the supervision of a practicing clinical neuropsychologist. I am a passionate volunteer too! In my free time, I dedicate my service to a wide range of voluntary roles, play the piano, occasionally play video games, and read fictional/ psychology novels. I love to write too, which explains the formation of this archive!

Psychologists work in many different settings, such as in the workplace (Occupational Psychologists), in the community (Health/ Community Psychologists), in criminal justice (Forensic Psychologists), and in clinical practice (Clinical Psychologists). Clinical Neuropsychology is a sub-speciality of Clinical Psychology, and concerns understanding the relationship between brain and behaviour. Their expertise are often leveraged to diagnose disorders of the brain, and assess cognitive-behavioural functioning to facilitate effective treatment.
